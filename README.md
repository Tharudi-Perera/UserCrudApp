# üåê Full Stack User Management Application

This is a full stack user management web application developed using React.js for the frontend, Spring Boot for the backend, and MySQL as the database. 

The application enables users to perform basic CRUD operations ‚Äî including creating new users, viewing a list of users, updating existing user information, and deleting users from the system. 

On the frontend, React provides a responsive and intuitive interface, allowing smooth navigation and interaction with form fields and user lists. The backend is powered by Spring Boot, which exposes a RESTful API to handle HTTP requests and perform operations using Spring Data JPA. All user data is securely stored and managed in a MySQL database. 

The application is structured with clear separation of concerns and follows a client-server architecture, making it a great demonstration of how frontend and backend technologies can work together to build scalable and maintainable software systems.
